      <p className='text-lg text-center text-white'>Welcome to my Projects section! Here, you'll find some of the websites and web applications I have built while learning and practicing full-stack development. These projects include both frontend and backend work, using tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, EJS, and MongoDB. <br /><br />
        I built these projects to improve my coding skills and understand how real-world applications work. Each project helped me learn new things like working with databases, handling user login systems, creating shopping carts, and designing user-friendly pages. <br /><br />
        Feel free to explore them by clicking the view button. I hope you enjoy seeing my progress!</p>
